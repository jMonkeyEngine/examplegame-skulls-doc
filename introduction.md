# Skulls! - A game about killing skulls

## Summary
Skulls! is an open source implementation of a classic PC game called Rats!. Skulls are the nasty remains of necromancers, trapped in a maze. The goal of the game is to prevent the Skulls from performing summoning-rituals to the point where youâ€™re unable to keep their population growth under control.

## Basic Gameplay
The game starts with a small number of Skulls populating a square, grid-based game map, shaped like a maze. The Skulls move randomly around this maze. When two Skulls (Mummy and Ghoul) meet, they commence a summoning ritual and spawn Young Skulls. To keep the Skulls population down, the player is equipped with an arsenal of brutal weapons, such as gas clouds and bombs.

## Win / Lose Conditions
Win the game by eliminating every single Skull.
Lose the game if the total number of Skulls exceeds 50.
