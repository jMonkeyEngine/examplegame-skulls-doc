# Skulls! - A game about killing skulls

## Summary
Skulls! is an open source implementation of a classic PC game called Rats!. The goal of the game is to keep the skulls - the nasty remains of necromancers - from doing summoning-rituals to the point where youâ€™re unable to keep their population growth under control.

## Basic Gameplay
The game starts with a small number of Skulls populating a square, grid-based game map, shaped like a maze. The Skulls will move randomly around this maze. When two Skulls of opposite colors (blue and pink) meet, they will commence a summoning ritual and new Skulls will be spawned. To keep the Skulls population down, the player is equipped with an arsenal of brutal weapons, such as gas clouds and bombs.

## Win / Lose Conditions
Win the game by eliminating every single Skull.
Lose the game if the total number of Skulls exceeds 50.
