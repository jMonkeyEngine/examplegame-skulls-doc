*Skulls* is an example game to be made for Desktop, Android and iOS devices. A shameless rip-off of the great [Rats!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnO406cOVmM&html5=1)

## Project Goals
Official open source game project for jMonkeyEngine 3
Official game demo (hopefully 1st of many) for jME3 on Google Play and App Store.

Source code:
https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/examplegame-skulls

- Game demo will be on Nicolaas de Bruyn’s Google Play account.
- Tutorials (when we get to that point) will be on wiki.jmonkeyengine.org, but could be cross-published (e.g. pitch to tutorials site.)

TODO:

- Settings Menu (Master Sound, Music and SFX)
- Power placement (transparency and so forth)
- Proper perspective explanation - [refpic](http://images.g4tv.com/ImageDb3/242124_l/e3-2010-bomberman-live-battlefest-screenshot.jpg)
- clarify “max stock = 4” concept for powers
